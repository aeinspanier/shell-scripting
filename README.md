# shell-scripting

This repository demonstrates basic shell scripting skills with several example scripts:

## Scripts

- **hello-world.sh**  
  Prints "Hello World" to the terminal...

- **variables.sh**  
  Shows how to use variables and command substitution. It sets a birth date, calculates the day of the week, and prints both.

- **pass-arguments.sh**  
  Demonstrates how to pass and process command-line arguments in a function. It prints the number of arguments and lists each one.

## Usage

Run any script from the terminal:

```sh
bash hello-world.sh
bash variables.sh
bash pass-arguments.sh one two three
```
